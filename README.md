# Dassault_Systemes_TASK

This project was completed as part of an assignment provided by Dassault Syst√®mes.

**Task 1: Analysis of Healthcare Data**
**Architecture:**

1) Data Loading:
Utilized Python's pandas library to load the healthcare data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

2) Data Exploration:
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and statistics.

3) Data Visualization:
Created visualizations using the seaborn library to analyze the correlation between Blood Group Type, Gender, and Medical Condition.

4) Data Analysis:
Calculated additional insights such as the average billing amount required to treat each medical condition by grouping the data based on Medical Condition.

**Task 2: Web Application for Medical Condition Prediction**
**Architecture:**

1) Flask Application:
Built a web application using the Flask framework, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.

2) User Input:
Users can enter their Name, Gender, and Blood Group into a web form provided by the application.

3) Data Processing:
Processed the user input when the form is submitted by the user.

4) Prediction:
Utilized the insights gained from Task 1 to predict the Medical Condition that the user is at most risk for based on their input.

5) Storage:
Stored all the data entered by users (Name, Gender, Blood Group, and predicted Medical Condition) in a separate CSV file at the backend for further analysis or reference.

**Note:**
In Task 2, I faced a small problem with the code while building the web application. Despite trying my best, I couldn't figure out the solution. I spent a lot of time and effort trying to fix it, but unfortunately, I couldn't. However, I want to assure you that I put in my best effort and tried my hardest to solve the problem. Even though I couldn't fix it, I believe the rest of the project shows my skills and dedication.
